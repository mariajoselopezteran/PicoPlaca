Hello to anyone reading this file. I created this simple program in order to predict if a car can circulate during Pico & placa. 
To run this program clone the repository to your machine. 

-Navigate to the solution folder in the explorer
-Go to file -> open in command prompt
-Run: dotnet build  
- type: 	cd picoplaca [enter]
	  	cd bin [enter]
   		cd Debug [enter]
 - Run: picoplaca .exe

Hope you enjoy.

Thanks.
